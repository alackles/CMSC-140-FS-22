## Overview

This course will teach you the basics of how to program with Python. 

It won't teach you theory of computer science, and it won't make you a Python magician, but it will make you functional at talking to your computer and asking it to do things for you. Think of it like a 10-week crash course in a foreign language: you won't become fluent, but you'll be able to read the bus schedule and ask for the restrooms. 

If that sounds like fun to you, then good! Let's go. If you're looking for something else, you maybe looking for [CMSC 150](https://www.lawrence.edu/academics/college/computer-science/course-descriptions).

## Learning Goals


By the end of this course, you should be able to do the following: 

- **L1: Basics**:  Take a problem, break it down into a series of steps (an algorithm), identify the programming components most appropriate to use for each step, use those components in Python to tell the computer how to solve the problem. Those components include:
  - variables
  - loops (for and while)
  - conditionals 
  - functions
  - lists
  - dictionaries
- **L2: Data Processing**: Process data from external files and user input to address a specific task related to that data  
- **L3: Debugging**: Debug syntactic and logical errors in a program in a systematic fashion, and know how to ask good questions when new problems arise
- **L4: Style**: Write code that is easy for others to understand because it uses effective variable names and comments, and is well-organized using functions (including main) and objects as appropriate
- **L5: Code Review**: Read and explain code written by others and approach that process in a systematic way
- **L6: Collaboration**: Use Git and GitHub to handle versioning of projects and sharing of projects with collaborators 
- **L7: Reflection**: Be able to reflect on your work and identify areas of strength and areas for improvement

Importantly, there are a few things you may find in first courses targeted at CS majors that this course **does not** cover. In particular, we will **not** focus on:

- Object-oriented programming. This is the biggest one; we will touch on what object-oriented programming is, but this is _not_ an OOP class.
- Graphical user interface tools for Python (though you can optionally explore these in your final project)
- Big-O notation and computational complexity
- Efficient sorting and searching 
- Recursion and dynamic programming 

This content is covered more thoroughly in CMSC 150, the course for majors. If any of these topics are of great importance to you, I suggest taking CMSC 150 instead of 140. 

## Assessment

This class will probably be graded very differently than you're used to. We'll take time at the beginning of class to discuss the structure and assessment for the class. **Please read everything below**, but here are the main bullet points:

- Every assessment (homework, labs, and final project) will be graded on a mastery scale
- Every learning objective will have associated assessments; demonstrating mastery of those assessments will demonstrate mastery of the learning objective
- The more learning objectives you demonstrate mastery of, the higher grade I can give you
- All assessments may be revised however much you wish

For more on why I'm doing this (if you're interested), see the Pedagogy section.

### Mastery-Based Grading Scheme

My goal for you this semester is that you come away as both a stronger programmer and a stronger learner. This course uses a version of _ungrading_ or _mastery-based grading_. Rather than assigning point values to homework, quizzes, or projects, all assessments will be graded on a mastery scale:

**Assessment Scale**

|  | | |
| ------ | ------- | ------ |
| **M** | Mastery | Demonstrates clear understanding of the learning objective; could explain the concept to others accurately; can implement without scaffolding |
| **P** | Proficient | Demonstrates some understanding of the learning objective; can sometimes implement but not yet consistently; needs scaffolding to implement properly |
| **N** | Novice | Does not yet have sufficient understanding of the learning objective; is beginning to build understanding but cannot implement consistently even with scaffolding |
| **IC** | Incomplete | Nothing written or turned in |
| | | |

### Learning Objectives

Each assessment you complete (homework, labs, projects) will have associated learning objectives (see HW1 for an example). You'll have at least 4 chances to demonstrate mastery of each learning objective. 

For each learning objective, you'll receive a grade on the same mastery scale as each individual assessment.

**Learning Objective Scale**

|  | | |
| ------ | ------- | ------ |
| **M** | Mastery | Demonstrates mastery on 70% or more of the associated assessments, and proficiency in remaining |
| **P** | Proficient | Demonstrates proficiency on 70% or more all associated assignments |
| **N** | Novice | Demonstrates novice work on 70% or more of the associated assessments |
| **IC** | Incomplete | Has not submitted at least 70% of the work for that objective |
| | | |

Below is an outline of which assessments match to which learning objectives, and how many mastery credits you need for each in brackets. Don't worry; as the semester goes on, I'll keep a tally for you of how you're doing on each (and you can always ask)

**L1: Basics** [9 of 12]
- All Homeworks (HW1-HW5)
- Labs: Week 1-5, Week 7
- Final Project

**L2: Data Processing** [3 of 4]
- HW6 
- Week 6 In-Class Project
- Week 7 Lab: Files 
- Final project

**L3: Debugging** [3 of 4]
- HW5 
- Week 8 Lab: Debug Challenge
- Week 9 In-Class Project
- Revision of any homework where you did _not_ earn mastery credit

**L4: Style** [8 of 11]
- All Homeworks (HW1-HW5)
- Labs: Weeks 1-5
- Final project 

**L5: Code Review** [3 of 4]
 - Week 3 In-Class Project
 - Week 7 Lab: Files 
 - Week 9 In-Class Project 
 - Final project feedback

**L6: Collaboration** [3 of 4]
- Week 1 Lab: Python Setup
- Week 7 Lab: Files 
- Week 8 Lab: Debug Challenge
- Final project 

**L7: Reflection**

This one iss slightly different; for mastery credit you must:

- Complete revisions of **any two assessments**. These assessments can even be ones you already earned mastery credit for the first time around. There's always something to tweak or try differently next time! 
- Complete your **final project reflection**.

You must do all three of these things for Mastery credit. 2/3 will earn a Proficiency; less than that will earn an Incomplete.

### Gradebook

This will translate to the gradebook as follows:

| **LU Grade** | CMSC 140 Requirements |
| ------- | ------- |
| **A** | Demonstrate mastery (**M**) for all 7 learning objectives.
| **B** | Demonstrate mastery (**M**) for 4-6 learning objectives and proficiency (**P**) in remaining objectives. NOTE: Must demonstrate Mastery (**M**) of **L1: Basics**. 
| **C** | Demonstrate proficiency (**P**) or better in all learning objectives. 
| **D** | Demonstrate proficiency (**P**) in 4-6 learning objectives and novice work (**N**) in remaining objectives. NOTE: Must demonstrate Proficiency (**P**) of **L1: Basics**.
| **F** | Demonstrates proficiency in fewer than 4 learning objectives  OR is not at least proficient in **L1: Basics**.

If you instead have an Incomplete (**IC**) in any learning objective, we'll talk on a case-by-case basis about the best outcome for you for the class. 

### Revisions

At any point, you can revise your assessments for a higher mastery score. You can even do this for assessments you have already revised. 

If you are revising **within one week** of the original due date, you can just resubmit the work without notifying me and I will update your score.

If you are revising **more than one week** after the original due date, you must get approval from me to submit a revision. I will almost certainly grant approval; this is just a way for me to avoid having too many revisions to review at once towards the end of the semester and keep things fair for all.


## Pedagogy

This section exists because I'm a big believer in transparency. For one, I think many students learn better when they understand their professors' teaching choices. For another, you're dedicating quite a lot of your time and money to be in this classroom; it seems only fair that you get insight into how it works. If you aren't interested in the pedagogy behind this course, feel free not to read this. But it is here for you if you want it. 

This syllabus is based heavily on one by Dr. Anya E. Vostinar.
