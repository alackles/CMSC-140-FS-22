# Guides

Guides to installation practices or supplementary materials will be listed here. 

[Install Python (Windows)](/CMSC-140-FS-22/guides/install-windows)

[Install Python (Mac)](/CMSC-140-FS-22/guides/install-mac)

[PyGame: 4 - 9](https://makingagameofit.github.io/lessons/)
# Additional Practice

Here are two sites for additional practice, each with solutions. These are available if you want to try them; there's no need to submit them.

## Basic Practice Problems

[PYnative](https://pynative.com/python-exercises-with-solutions/)

These problems are pretty straightforward ways to get used to the basics of Python programming

It is split into sections by topic, and we've covered most everything up to the Dictionary exercises. 

## Word Problems

[w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/)

For problems more like the ones I ask on the homeworks, this site gives you more vague instructions about what to do with your program, and you have to practice interpreting it. 

We have covered up to about #40 in class, but there may be things mixed in we haven't covered. 

## Challenge Problems

These problems go beyond the material we cover in class and introduce additional concepts and tools in Python that may be of interest to you.
