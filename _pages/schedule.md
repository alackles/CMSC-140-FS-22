This is a rough schedule of topics for each day, and the release and due dates for homework assignments. 

Reading should be completed **before** the class day that they are listed; the morning reading quizzes will reflect those topics.

"Sweigart" refers to the textbook, _Automate the Boring Stuff with Python_ 2nd ed. All reading should come with links.
